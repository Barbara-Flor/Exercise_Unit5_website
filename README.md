GIT EXERCISE
In this exercise we are going to use Git with a GitHub repository in order to create a website and after each exercise we push the changes to the GitHub repository.
I have created a new repository in GitHub with this readme file. I have created to a copy on my computer of the repository. Then, I created a simple web page adding the commit message, then in this web page we added a image, After that we use a new local branch, then we add new information to the footer. Then we merge this branch to the main. And at the end we did another local branch, add new information to the website body to generate a conflict that we must solve.
